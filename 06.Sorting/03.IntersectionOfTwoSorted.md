## Intersection of two sorted arrays

Given two sorted arrays `arr1[]` and `arr2[]` of sizes `N` and `M` respectively. The task is to find intersection of the two arrays.

The intersection of two arrays contains the elements common to both the arrays. The intersection should not count duplicate elements.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
M = 5, arr2 [] = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: 2 and 4 are only common
elements in both the arrays.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}
M = 6, arr2[] = {2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: 2 and 4 are the only
common elements.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input:
N = 2, arr1[] = {1, 2}
M = 2, arr2[] = {3, 4}
Output: -1
Explanation: No common elements.
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printIntersection()` that takes `N` and `M` as parameters and return the array the intersection of two arrays. If the intersection is empty then return `-1`.  
The newline is appended by driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N + M)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N + M)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N, M <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i], brr[i] <= 10^6
```

```c++
/* Function prints Intersection of arr1[] and arr2[]
N is the number of elements in arr1[]
M is the number of elements in arr2[]
Return the array
*/
vector<int> printIntersection(int arr1[], int arr2[], int N, int M)
{
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    vector<int> res;
    while(i < N && j < M) {
        if(i > 0 && arr1[i-1] == arr1[i]) {
            i++;
            continue;
        }
        if(arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
            res.push_back(arr1[i]);
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (arr1[i] > arr2[j])
            j++;
         else if(arr2[j] > arr1[i])
            i++;
    }
    if(res.size() == 0)
        res.push_back(-1);
    return res;
}
```
