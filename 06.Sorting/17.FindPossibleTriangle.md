## Count possible triangles

Given an unsorted array `arr[]` of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
3
3 5 4

Output:
1

Explanation:
A triangle is possible
with all the elements 5, 3 and 4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
5
6 4 9 7 8

Output:
10

Explanation:
There are 10 triangles
possible  with the given elements like
(6,4,9), (6,7,8),...
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `findNumberOfTriangles()` that takes arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the count of total possible triangles.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N^2)`.  
Expected Space Complexity: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
3 <= N <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 103
```

```c++
int findNumberOfTriangles(int arr[], int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        for(int i= n-1; i > 1; i--) {   //i starts from n-1 to 2 (0 1 are not possible).
            int left = 0, right = i-1; // here i is taken as c and left and right are taken as a and b, such that a+b > c
            while(left < right) {
                if(arr[left]+ arr[right] > arr[i]) { // a+b > c
                    count += right-left;
                    // this means all the elements from a till b(not b) taken as 'a' should also satisfy the cond.
                    right--;    //decreasing b to check for other combinations
                } else {
                    left++;     //increasing the left because the condition if failing, and right can't be increased, b'coz right is already maximum
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
