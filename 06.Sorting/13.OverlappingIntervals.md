## Overlapping Intervals

Given a collection of Intervals,merge all the overlapping Intervals.
For example:

Given `[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]`,

return `[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]`.

Make sure the returned intervals are sorted.

#### Input:

The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases.
Then following T lines contains an integer N depicting the number of Intervals and next line followed by the intervals starting and ending positions 'x' and 'y' respectively.

#### Output:

Print the intervals after overlapping in sorted manner. There should be a newline at the end of output of every test case.

#### Constraints:

```
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 100
```

#### Example:

```
Input
2
4
1 3 2 4 6 8 9 10
4
6 8 1 9 2 4 4 7

Output
1 4 6 8 9 10
1 9
```

```c++
bool myComp(pair<int, int> a, pair<int, int> b) {
    return a.first < b.first;
}

void printOverlapping(vector<pair<int, int>> a, int n) {
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), myComp);   //Sorting based on the first index
    int res = 0;    //Holds the range of the merged pairs
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        if(a[i].first <= a[res].second) {   //Comparing with the previous merged
            a[res].second = max(a[res].second, a[i].second);    //If it lies with the previous merged
        } else {
            res++;  //If it doesn't lie with the previous merged
            a[res] = a[i];  // Forwarding the res
        }
    }
    for(int i=0; i<=res; i++) { //Only till the res has merged pairs
        cout << a[i].first <<" "<<a[i].second<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
```
