## Minimum Number in a sorted rotated array

Given an array of distinct elements which was initially sorted. This array is rotated at some unknown point. The task is to find the minimum element in the given sorted and rotated array.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1}
Output: 1
Explanation: The array is rotated
once anti-clockwise. So minium
element is at last index (n-1)
which is 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {3,4,5,1,2}
Output: 1
Explanation: The array is rotated
and the minimum element present is
at index (n-2) which is 1.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `minNumber()` which takes the array `arr[]` and its starting and ending indices (low and high) as inputs and returns the minimum element in the given sorted and rotated array.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(LogN)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(LogN)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^7
```

```c++
// Function to find the minimum element in sorted and rotated array
// arr: input array
// low and high are 0 and n-1, where n is the size of arr
int minNumber(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    while(low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
        if(mid == 0 || arr[mid] < arr[mid-1]) {
            return arr[mid];
        } else if (arr[mid] > arr[high]) {
            low = mid+1;
        } else {
            high = mid; //for 60 10 20 30 40 50
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
