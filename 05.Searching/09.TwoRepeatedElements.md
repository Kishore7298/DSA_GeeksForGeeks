## Two Repeated Elements

You are given an array of N+2 integer elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to N. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
array[] = {1,2,1,3,4,3}
Output: 1 3
Explanation: In the given array,
1 and 3 are repeated two times.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2
array[] = {1,2,2,1}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: In the given array,
1 and 2 are repeated two times
and second occurence of 2 comes
before 1. So the output is 2 1.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `repeatedElements()` which takes array `arr[]` and an integer `N` as inputs (the size of the array is `N + 2` and elements are in `range[1, N]`) and finds the two repeated element in the array and return them in a pair.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ array[i] ≤ N
```

```c++
// Function to find the two repeated element
// arr: input array
// N: denoting that the size of array is N + 2 and range of elements is [1, N]
pair<int,int> twoRepeated (int arr[], int N)
{
    int first = 0;
    int second = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<N+2; i++) {
        if(arr[abs(arr[i])-1] < 0) {
            if(first == 0) {
                first = abs(arr[i]);
            } else {
                second = abs(arr[i]);
            }
        } else {
            arr[abs(arr[i])-1] *= -1;
        }
    }
    return {first, second};
}
```
