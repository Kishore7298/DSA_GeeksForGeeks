## Count only Repeated

Given an array arr[] of N positive integers, where elements are consecutive (sorted). Also, there is a single element which is repeating X (any variable) number of times. Now, the task is to find the element which is repeated and number of times it is repeated.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,3,4}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 is
occuring two times.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2,3,4,5,5}
Output: 5 2
Explanation: In the given array, 5 is
occuring two times.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete findRepeating function and return pair of element which is repeated and the number of times it is repeated. The printing is done by the driver code.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= arr[i] <= 1015
```

Expected Time Complexity : `O(logN)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```c++
// arr : given array
// n : size of the array
pair<int, int> findRepeating(int *arr, int n){
    int firstElem = arr[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) //Reducing all the elements to 0-based index
        arr[i] -= (firstElem);

    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int repeating, repeatCount; //Stores repeating element and the repeat count
    while (low <= high)
    {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] != mid)
            if (mid != 0 && arr[mid - 1] == (mid - 1))
            {   //if the mid-1 is matching the index them this is the repeating elem
                repeating = arr[mid]+firstElem;
                break;
            }
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        else
            low = mid + 1;
    }
    repeatCount = n - arr[n - 1];
    return {repeating, repeatCount};
}
```
