## Left Index

Given a sorted array of positive integers (elements may be repeated) and a number x. The task is to find the leftmost index of x in the given array.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,6,7}
X = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 is present two times
in the array and its leftmost index
is 0.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {10,20,20,20,20,20,20}
X = 20
Output: 1
Explanation: 20 is present 5 time,
but its leftmost index is 1.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `leftIndex()` which takes the array `arr[]`, its size `N` and an integer `X` as inputs and returns the index of leftmost occurrence of `X` in given input array. It returns `-1` if element is not present in the array.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(LogN)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
1 <= x <= 10^6
```

```c++
// Function to find element in sorted array

int leftIndex(int N, int arr[], int X){
    int low = 0;
    int high = N-1;
    while(low<=high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
        if(arr[mid] == X) {
            if(mid == 0 || arr[mid-1] != X) {
                return mid;
            } else {
                high = mid-1;
            }
        } else if(arr[mid] > X) {
            high = mid-1;
        } else if (arr[mid] < X) {
            low = mid+1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
