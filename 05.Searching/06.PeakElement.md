## Peak element

Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in A in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, consider only one neighbour.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array,
3 is the peak element as it is
greater than its neighbour.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2
A[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 is the peak element
as it is greater than its neighbour
elements.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. Just complete the provided function `peakElement()` and return a valid index with respect to 0 based indexing.  
Note 1: Multiple peak element may be possible, in that case return any of the valid index .  
Note 2: If you click on Compile and Test the output will be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(log N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[] <= 10^6
```

```c++
int findPeakUtil(int arr[], int low, int high, int n)
{

    int mid = (low+high)>>1;

    // if mid is last or first index with first element
    // greater than next.
    // Also, check if mid element is greater than mid - 1 and mid+1
    if ((mid == 0 || arr[mid-1] <= arr[mid]) &&
            (mid == n-1 || arr[mid+1] <= arr[mid]))
        return mid;

    // If mid is other than 0, then check if mid element is less than prev.
    // If so, then recurse for lower half
    else if (mid > 0 && arr[mid-1] > arr[mid])
        return findPeakUtil(arr, low, (mid -1), n);

    // else recurse for the upper half
    else return findPeakUtil(arr, (mid + 1), high, n);
}

int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
{
    return findPeakUtil(arr, 0, n-1, n);
}
```
