## Square root

Given an integer x. The task is to find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return `floor(√x)`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not perfect
square, so floor of square_root of
5 is 2.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect
square, so its square root is 2.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `floorSqrt()` which should return the square root of given number x.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(log N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ x ≤ 107
```

```c++
long long int floorSqrt(long long int x)
{
    if(x==1 || x ==0){
        return x;
    }
    long long start=1, end =x;
    long long ans;

    while(start <= end){
        long long middle = (start +end)/2;
        if(middle*middle == x){
            return middle;
        }
        if(middle*middle <x){
            start = middle+1;
            ans = middle;
        } else {
            end = middle-1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
