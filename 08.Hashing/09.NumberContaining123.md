## Numbers containing 1, 2 and 3

Given an array arr[] of N numbers. The task is to print only those numbers whose digits are from set `{1,2,3}`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {4,6,7}
Output: -1
Explanation: No elements are there in the
array which contains digits 1, 2 or 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1,2,3,4}
Output: 1 2 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are the only
elements in the array which conatins
digits as 1, 2 or 3.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete `findAll` function and marked satisfied number as '1' in the map mp in range 1 to 1000000. If no number is marked as satified number -1 will automatically be printed by the drivers code. The driver code prints the elements in sorted order.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
```

```c++
map<int,int> mp; // mp hold 1 to those number which consists of only 1, 2, 3 as digits only
void findAll() {
    int num=1,num2;
    vector<int> a; int j=1;
    a.push_back(j);
    a.push_back(j+1);
    a.push_back(j+2);
    mp[1]=1;
    mp[2]=1;
    mp[3]=1;

    j=0;

    // push the elements which have digits as 1, 2, and 3 only
    while(num<=1000000) {
        num2=a[j++];

        if((num2*10)+1<=1000000) {
            a.push_back((num2*10)+1);
            mp[num2*10+1]=1;
        }

        if((num2*10)+2<=1000000) {
            a.push_back((num2*10)+2);
            mp[num2*10+2]=1;
        }

        num2=(num2*10)+3;

        if(num2<=1000000) {
            a.push_back(num2);
            mp[num2]=1;
        }

        num=num2;
    }
}
```
