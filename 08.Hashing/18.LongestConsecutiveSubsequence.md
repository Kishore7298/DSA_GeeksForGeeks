## Longest consecutive subsequence

Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
Output: 6
Explanation: The consecutive numbers
here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6
numbers form the longest consecutive
subsquence.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 7
a[] = {1,9,3,10,4,20,2}
Output: 4
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest
consecutive subsequence.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `findLongestConseqSubseq()` which takes the array `arr[]` and the size of the array as inputs and returns the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= a[i] <= 10^5
```

```c++
// arr[] : the input array
// N : size of the array arr[]

// return the length of the longest subsequene of consecutive integers
int findLongestConseqSubseq(int arr[], int n) {
  unordered_set<int> st;
  int maxCount = 1;
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      st.insert(arr[i]);
  }
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      if(st.find(arr[i]-1) != st.end()) continue;
      else {
          int localCount = 1;
          int j = arr[i];
          while(st.find(j+1) != st.end()) {
              localCount++;
              j++;
          }
          maxCount = max(maxCount, localCount);
      }
  }
  return maxCount;
}
```
