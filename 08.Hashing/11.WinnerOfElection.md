## Winner of an election

Given an array of names (consisting of lowercase characters) of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted to the candidate. Print the name of candidate that received Max votes. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 13
Votes[] = {john,johnny,jackie,johnny,john
jackie,jamie,jamie,john,johnny,jamie,
johnny,john}
Output: john 4
Explanation: john has 4 votes casted for
him, but so does johny. john is
lexicographically smaller, so we print
john and the votes he received.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3
Votes[] = {andy,blake,clark}
Output: andy 1
Explanation: All the candidates get 1
votes each. We print andy as it is
lexicographically smaller.
```

#### Your Task:

You only need to complete the function `winner()` that takes an array of strings arr, and n as parameters and returns the name of the candiate with maximum votes and the number of votes the candidate got as an array of size 2.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
```

```c++
// Funtion to find winner
// arr[]: input array
// n: size of array

pair <string,int> winner(string arr[],int n) {
    pair<string, int> pr;
    unordered_map<string, int> mp;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        mp[arr[i]]++;
    }
    int max = 0;
    for(auto i: mp) {
        if(i.second > max) {
            max = i.second;
        }
    }
    vector<string> name;
    for(auto i: mp) {
        if(i.second == max) {
            name.push_back(i.first);
        }
    }
    sort(name.begin(), name.end());
    pr.first = name[0];
    pr.second = max;
    return pr;
}
```
