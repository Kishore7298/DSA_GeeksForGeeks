You are given an array of distinct integers and a sum. Check if there's a pair with the given sum in the array.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
14

Output:
1

Explanation:
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
and sum = 14.  There is a pair {4, 10}
with sum 14.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
2
2 5
10

Output:
0

Explanation:
arr[]  = {2, 5} and sum = 10.
There is no pair with sum 10.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the provided function `sumExists ()` which take the array arr[], its size N, and an integer sum as inputs and returns true if there exists a pair with the given sum in the array, else, it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 10^6
1 <= sum <= 1000
```

```c++
//You need to complete this function, Geeks
int sumExists(int arr[], int N, int sum)
{
   unordered_set<int> st;
   for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
       if(st.find(arr[i]) != st.end())
            return 1;
        else
            st.insert(sum-arr[i]);
   }
   return 0;
}
```
