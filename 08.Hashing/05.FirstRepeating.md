## First Repeating Element

Given an array arr[] of size N. The task is to find the first repeating element in an array of integers, i.e., an element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
7
1 5 3 4 3 5 6

Output:
2

Explanation:
5 is appearing twice and
its first appearence is at index 2
which is less than 3 whose first
occuring index is 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
-1

Explanation:
All elements appear
only once so -1 is printed.
Input :
The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. In each test cases, First line is number of elements in array N and second its values.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete `firstRepeated()` function and return the index of first repeated element, if there is not any repeating element then return “-1” (without quotes). Use 1 Based Indexing.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= Ai <= 10^6
```

Expected Time Complexity : `O(NlogN)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(N)`

```c++
// arr : given array
// n : size of the array

int firstRepeated(int arr[], int n) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        mp[arr[i]]++;
    }
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        if(mp[arr[i]] > 1) {
            return i+1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
