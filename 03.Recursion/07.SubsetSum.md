## Subset Sum

Count the number of subsets whose sum is equal to the k from the given array.

```c++
int countSubsets(int arr[], int n, int sum)
{
	if(n==0)
		return sum==0? 1 : 0;
    /*
        Count of subsets which equal to given sum by including the element in the index n
        +
        Count of subsets which equal to given sum by not including the element of the index n
    */
	return countSubsets(arr, n-1, sum) + countSubsets(arr, n-1, sum - arr[n-1]);
}

```
