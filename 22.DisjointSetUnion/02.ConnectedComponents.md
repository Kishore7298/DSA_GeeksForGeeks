## Number of Connected Components

This problem is to find the number of connected components. There will be 2 incomplete functions namely unionNodes and findNumberOfConnectedNodes. You have to complete these functions.

unionNodes: Join two subsets into a single set.
findNumberOfConnectedNodes: Determine number of different connected components in a graph.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
M = 2
Edges[] = {(1,3),(1,5)}
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially all nodes 1 2 3 4 5
are not connected.
After 1 3, node 1 and 3 will be connected.
After 1 5, node 1 and 5 will be connected.
Finally we have {1,3,5}, {2}, {4}. So we
have a total of 3 connected components.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
M = 4
Edges[] = {(1,4),(2,3),(1,5)}
Output: 2
Explanation: Initially all nodes 1 2 3 4 5
are not connected.
After 1 4, node 1 and 4 will be connected.
After 2 3, node 2 and 3 will be connected.
After 1 5, node 1 and 5 will be connected.
Finally we have {1,4,5}, {2, 3}. So we
have total of 2 connected components
```

#### Your Task:

You have to complete the function `unionNodes()` which merges the node1 and node2. You will also have to complete the function `findNumberOfConnectedNodes()` function will returntotal number of different connected components in a graph.

```
Note: We recommend you to solve this problem first https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/union-find/1. There are ways to solve this problem from BFS and DFS as well. But for this problem stick to filling these functions as in union-find.
```

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= M <= 10^5
1 <= node1, node2 <= N
```

```c++
//User function Template for C++
int find(int x, int par[]) {
    if(par[x] == x) {
        return x;
    }
    return par[x] = find(par[x], par);
}

/* This function does union of 2 nodes a and b */
// a : node 1
// b : node 2
// arr : array (n+1) size with elements from 1 to N equal to its index.
// rank1 : array (n+1) size with all elements equal to 1.
// n : Number of nodes
void unionNodes( int a, int b, int par[], int rank1[], int n) {
    int a_par = find(a, par);
    int b_par = find(b, par);
    if(a_par == b_par)
        return;
    if(rank1[a_par] > rank1[b_par]) {
        par[b_par] = a_par;
    } else if (rank1[b_par] > rank1[a_par]) {
        par[a_par] = b_par;
    } else {
        par[a_par] = b_par;
        rank1[b_par]++;
    }
}

/* This function returns number of connected components */
// arr : array (n+1) size with elements from 1 to N equal to its index.
// rank1 : array (n+1) size with all elements equal to 1.
// n : Number of nodes
int findNumberOfConnectedComponents( int n, int arr[], int rank1[]) {
    int count = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        count += arr[i] == i;
    }
    return count;
}
