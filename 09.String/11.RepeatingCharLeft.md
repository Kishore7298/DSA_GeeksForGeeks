## Repeating Character - First Appearance Leftmost

You are given a string S (both uppercase and lowercase characters). You need to print the repeated character whose first appearance is leftmost.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
S = geeksforgeeks
Output: g
Explanation: We see that both e and g
repeat as we move from left to right.
But the leftmost is g so we print g.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
S = abcd
Output: -1
Explanation: No character repeats so
we print -1.
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `repeatedCharacter()` that takes a string as a parameter and returns the index of the character. If no character repeats then return `-1`.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Number of distinct characters)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 100
```

```c++

//Back-end complete function Template for C++
const int CHAR = 256;
//Return the index of the character or return -1
int repeatedCharacter (string s)
{
    int mini = INT_MAX;
    bool visited[CHAR];
    fill(visited, visited+CHAR, false);
    for(int i=s.length()-1; i>=0; i--) {
        if(visited[s[i]])
            mini = min(mini, i);
        else
            visited[s[i]] = true;
    }
    return mini == INT_MAX ? -1: mini;
}
```
