## Sum of numbers in string

Given a string str containing alphanumeric characters. The task is to calculate the sum of all the numbers present in the string.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
str = 1abc23
Output: 24
Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the
string which is added to get the sum as
24.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
str = geeks4geeks
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the only number, so the
sum is 4.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `findSum()` which finds and returns the sum of numbers in the string.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= length of the string <= 10^5
Sum of Numbers <= 10^5
```

```c++
// Function to calculate sum of all numbers present
// in a string containing alphanumeric characters
int findSum(string str)
{
    int sum =0;
	int i = 0;
	while(i<str.length()) {
	    string local;
	    while(isdigit(str[i])) {
	        local += str[i];
	        i++;
	        if(i == str.length() || !isdigit(str[i])) {
	            sum += stoi(local);
	        }
	    }
	    i++;
	}
	return sum;
}
```
