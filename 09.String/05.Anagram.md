## Anagram

Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are an anagram of each other.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have same
characters with same frequency. So,
both are anagrams.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation:Characters in both the strings
are not same, so they are not anagrams.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `isAnagram()` which checks if the two strings are an anagram of each other. The function returns true if the strings are anagram else it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Number of distinct characters).`

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5
```

```c++
const int CHAR = 256;
/*  Function to check if two strings are anagram
*   c, d: input string
*/
bool isAnagram(string c, string d) {
    int freq[CHAR] = {0};
    if(c.length() != d.length())
        return false;
    for(int i=0; i<c.length(); i++) {
        freq[c[i]]++;
        freq[d[i]]--;
    }
    for(int i=0; i<CHAR; i++) {
        if(freq[i] > 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
