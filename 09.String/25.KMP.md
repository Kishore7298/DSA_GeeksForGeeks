## Pattern Search KMP

Given a string S and a pattern P of all lowercase characters. The task is to check if the pattern exists in the string or not.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
S = aabaacaadaabaaba
P = aaaab
Output: No
Explanation: Given pattern is not found
in the given string S.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
S = aabaacaadaabaaba
P = caada
Output: Yes
Explanation: Given pattern is found in
the given string S.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `KMPSearch()` which returns true or false depending on whether pattern is present in the string or not, and `computeLPSArray()` which computes the longest prefix suffix for every index.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N+M)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(M)`.  
Note: N = |S|, M = |P|.

```
Constrsaints:
1 <= |S|, |P| <= 10^4
```

```c++
//Code needs to be added
```
