## Check if string is rotated by two places

Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if the string 'b' can be obtained by rotating another string 'a' by exactly 2 places.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
a = amazon
b = azonam
Output: 1
Explanation: amazon can be rotated anti
clockwise by two places, which will make
it as azonam.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
a = geeksforgeeks
b = geeksgeeksfor
Output: 0
Explanation: If we rotate geeksforgeeks by
two place in any direction , we won't get
geeksgeeksfor.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `isRotated()` which takes two strings as input parameters and checks if given strings can be formed by rotations. The function returns true if string 1 can be obtained by rotating string 2 by two places, else it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Space Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Challenge: Try doing it in `O(1)` space complexity.

```
Constraints:
1 <= length of a, b < 100
```

```c++
/*  Function to check if str1 can be formed from
*   str2 after rotation by 2 places
*/
bool isRotated(string str1, string str2)
{
    int i1 = str1.length();
    int i2 = str2.length();
    if (i1 != i2)
        return false;
    if(i1 <= 2)
        return str1 == str2;
    if(str2.substr(i1 - 2, i1) + str2.substr(0, i1 - 2) == str1)
        return true;
    if(str2.substr(2, i1) + str2.substr(0, 2) == str1)
        return true;
    return false;
}
```
