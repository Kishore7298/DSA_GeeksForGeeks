## Implement strstr

Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = Fr
Output: -1
Explanation: Fr is not present in the
string GeeksForGeeks as substring.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = For
Output: 5
Explanation: For is present as substring
in GeeksForGeeks from index 5 (0 based
indexing).
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to take any input. Just complete the `strstr()` function which takes two strings str, target as an input parameter. The function returns `-1` if no match if found else it returns an integer denoting the first occurrence of the x in the string s.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(|s|*|x|)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

Note : Try to solve the question in constant space complexity.

```
Constraints:
1 <= |s|,|x| <= 1000
```

```c++
/* The function should return position where the target string
   matches the string str
Your are required to complete this method */
int strstr(string s, string x)
{
    int count =0;
    const int xLength = x.length();
    for(int i=0;i<s.length()-xLength+1;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<x.length();j++){
            if(s[i+j]==x[j]){
                count++;
                if(count ==xLength)
                    return i;
            } else {
                count =0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
