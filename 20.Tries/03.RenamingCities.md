## Renaming Cities

Some cities are going to be renamed and accordingly name of their railway stations will also change. Changing the name of railway station should also result in changed station code. Railways have an idea that station code should be the shortest prefix out of all railway stations renamed prior to this. If some city has same name, then prefix will be the name with suffix as the count of occurence of that city prior to this and including this, seperated with spaces.

Given N renamed cities consisting of lowercase alphabets only. The task is to generate a station ID for all the stations.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 6
Cities[] = {shimla,safari,jammu,delhi,
                jammu,dehradun}
Output:
s
sa
j
d
jammu 2
deh
Explanation: Till shimla, no stations
are there. So, it's first character
will be the unique smallest prefix. For
safari, first character of shimla
matches, so unique smallest prefix is sa
Similarly, j is smallest unique prefix
for jammu and d is for delhi. For last
city jammu, we have countered jammu
before, and therefor no smallest prefix
is possible. So, we can generate its
code as jammu with suffix equal to the
count of jammu, i.e, 2. Smallest unique
prefix is jammu2. Now, delhi can be
renamed as d, and dehradun can be
renamed as deh, since deh is the
smallest non matching prefix.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete check function which takes array of strings and number of string 'n' as arguments and print the require answer in the function itself. You have to provide new line in the function itself.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
```

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N * WORD_LEN)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N * WORD_LEN)`.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

    int count1;

    Node *temp = new Node();
    temp->isEndOfWord = false;
    // int count1 = 0;
    return temp;
}

            arr[i] = s;
        }
        check(arr,n);
    }
    return 0;
}
// arr : array of strings
// n : count of the number of strings in the array
void check(string *arr, int n){
    Node* root = newNode();
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        string element = arr[i];
        string stationCode = "";
        bool codeSet = false;
        Node *temp  = root;
        for(int j=0; j<element.length(); j++) {
            if(temp->mp.find(element[j]) == temp->mp.end()) {
                if(codeSet == false) {
                    codeSet = true;
                    stationCode += element[j];
                }
                temp->mp[element[j]] = newNode();
                temp = temp->mp[element[j]];
            } else {
                stationCode += element[j];
                temp = temp->mp[element[j]];
            }
        }
        if(temp->isEndOfWord == true) {
                stationCode += " 2";
        }
        temp->isEndOfWord = true;
        cout<<stationCode<<endl;
    }
}
```
