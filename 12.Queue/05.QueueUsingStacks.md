Queue using two Stacks
Implement a Queue using 2 stacks `s1` and `s2` .
A Query `Q` is of 2 Types  
`(i) 1 x (a query of this type means pushing 'x' into the queue)`  
`(ii) 2 (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)`

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2

Output:
2 3

Explanation:
In the first testcase
1 2 the queue will be {2}
1 3 the queue will be {2 3}
2 poped element will be 2 the queue
will be {3}
1 4 the queue will be {3 4}
2 poped element will be 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
4
1 2 2 2 1 4

Output:
2 -1

Explanation:
In the second testcase
1 2 the queue will be {2}
2 poped element will be 2 and
then the queue will be empty
2 the queue is empty and hence -1
1 4 the queue will be {4}.
```

#### Your Task:

You are required to complete the two methods `push` which take one argument an integer `'x'` to be pushed into the queue and `pop` which returns a integer poped out from other queue(`-1` if the queue is empty). The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(1) for both push() and O(N) for pop().`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(N).`

```
Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100
```

```c++
/* The structure of the class is
class StackQueue{
private:
    stack<int> s1;
    stack<int> s2;
public:
    void push(int);
    int pop();
}; */

/* The method push to push element into the queue */
void StackQueue :: push(int x)
 {
    while(s1.empty() != true) {
        s2.push(s1.top());
        s1.pop();
    }
    s1.push(x);
    while(s2.empty() != true) {
        s1.push(s2.top());
        s2.pop();
    }
 }

/*The method pop which return the element poped out of the queue*/
int StackQueue :: pop()
{
    if(s1.empty())
        return -1;
    int ele = s1.top();
    s1.pop();
    return ele;
}
```
