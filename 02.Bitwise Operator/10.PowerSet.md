Given a string S find all possible substrings of the string in lexicographically-sorted order.

#### Example 1:

```
Input : str = "abc"
Output: a ab abc ac b bc c
Explanation : There are 7 substrings that
can be formed from abc.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: str = "aa"
Output: a a aa
Explanation : There are 3 substrings that
can be formed from aa.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read ot print anything. Your task is to complete the function AllPossibleStrings() which takes S as input parameter and returns a list of all possible substrings(non-empty) that can be formed from S in lexicographically-sorted order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(2n) where n is the length of the string`  
Expected Space Complexity : `O(n * 2n)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= Length of string <= 16
```

```c++
vector<string> AllPossibleStrings(string s){
    vector<string> result;
    int total = pow(2, s.length()); // powerset length
    for(int counter = 1; counter < total; counter++) {  // starting from 1(we are not considering null)
        string res;
        for(int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            if(counter & (1 << j)) {    // choosing the char from string whose counter bit is set
                res += s[j];
            }
        }
        result.push_back(res);
    }
    sort(result.begin(), result.end()); // Returning the lexographically ordered set
    return result;
}
```
