## Fixing Two nodes of a BST

Two of the nodes of a Binary Search Tree (BST) are swapped. Fix (or correct) the BST by swapping them back. Do not change the structure of the tree.

Note: It is guaranteed than the given input will form BST, except for 2 nodes that will be wrong.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       10
     /    \
    5      8
   / \
  2   20
Output: 1
Explanation:
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
         11
       /    \
      3      17
       \    /
        4  10
Output: 1
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to take any input. Just complete the function `correctBst()` that takes root node as parameter. The function should return the root of corrected BST. BST will then be checked by driver code and 0 or 1 will be printed.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(n)`

Expected Auxiliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 1000
```

```c++
// The approach here is to consider is there are misplaced elements in a sorted array, which needs to be swapped

void correctBSTUtil(Node* root, Node* &prev, Node* &first, Node* &second) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    correctBSTUtil(root->left, prev, first, second);
    if(prev != NULL && prev->data > root->data) {   // This has been handled this way because,
        if(first == NULL)                           // To handle the corner case of adjacent swaps
            first = prev;                           // In adjacent swaps prev and curr element needs to be swapped
        second = root;
    }
    prev = root;
    correctBSTUtil(root->right, prev, first, second);
}

struct Node *correctBST( struct Node* root )
{
    if(root == NULL)
        return NULL;
    Node *prev = NULL, *first = NULL, *second = NULL;
    correctBSTUtil(root, prev, first, second);  // Finding the two elems which needs to be swapped
    // Swapping the elements
    int temp = first->data;
    first->data = second->data;
    second->data = temp;
    return root;
}
```
