## Print BST elements in given range

Given a Binary Search Tree and a range. Find all the numbers in the BST that lie in the given range.
Note: Element greater than or equal to root go to the right side.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       17
     /    \
    4     18
  /   \
 2     9
l = 4, h = 24
Output: 4 9 17 18
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
       16
     /    \
    7     20
  /   \
 1    10
l = 13, h = 23
Output: 16 20
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `printNearNodes()` which takes the root Node of the BST and the range elements low and high as inputs and returns an array that contains the BST elements in the given range low to high (inclusive) in non-decreasing order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of the BST)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 10^4
1 <= l < h < 10^5
```

```c++
/* The structure of a BST Node is as follows:

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

void printNearNodesUtil(Node* root, int low, int high, vector<int> &res) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    if(root->data > low)    // Recurse only till range doesn't cross the low
        printNearNodesUtil(root->left, low, high, res);

    if(root->data >= low && root->data <= high) // Add if it lies within the range
        res.push_back(root->data);
    if(root->data < high)   // Recurse only till range doesn't cross the high
        printNearNodesUtil(root->right, low, high, res);
}

// returns an array of node values in the BST (rooted at 'root')
// that lie in the given range [low, high]
vector<int> printNearNodes(Node *root, int low, int high)
{
  vector<int> res;
  printNearNodesUtil(root, low, high, res);
  return res;
}
```
