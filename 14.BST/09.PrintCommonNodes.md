## Print Common Nodes in two BSTs

Given two Binary Search Trees(without duplicates). Find need to print the common nodes in them. In other words, find intersection of two BSTs

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
BST1:
                  5
               /     \
             1        10
           /   \      /
          0     4    7
                      \
                       9
BST2:
                10
              /    \
             7     20
           /   \
          4     9
Output: 4 7 9 10
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
BST1:
     10
    /  \
   2   11
  /  \
 1   3
BST2:
       2
     /  \
    1    3
Output: 1 2 3
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `printCommon()` that takes roots of both the BSTs as input and returns an array containing the intersection of the 2 BSTs in a sorted order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N1 + N2)` where `N1` and `N2` are the sizes of the 2 BSTs.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(H1 + H2)` where `H1` and `H2` are the Heights of the 2 BSTs.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
```

```c++
/*Node structure

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

// return a vector containing the intersection of the two BSTs in a sorted order
vector <int> printCommon(Node *root1, Node *root2)
{
     vector<int> res;
     stack<Node *> stack1, s1, s2;

    while (1)
    {
        // push the Nodes of first tree in stack s1
        if (root1)
        {
            s1.push(root1);
            root1 = root1->left;
        }

        // push the Nodes of second tree in stack s2
        else if (root2)
        {
            s2.push(root2);
            root2 = root2->left;
        }

        // Both root1 and root2 are NULL here
        else if (!s1.empty() && !s2.empty())
        {
            root1 = s1.top();
            root2 = s2.top();

            // If current keys in two trees are same
            if (root1->data == root2->data)
            {
                res.push_back(root1->data);
                s1.pop();
                s2.pop();

                // move to the inorder successor
                root1 = root1->right;
                root2 = root2->right;
            }

            else if (root1->data < root2->data)
            {
                // If Node of first tree is smaller, than that of
                // second tree, then its obvious that the inorder
                // successors of current Node can have same value
                // as that of the second tree Node. Thus, we pop
                // from s2
                s1.pop();
                root1 = root1->right;

                // root2 is set to NULL, because we need
                // new Nodes of tree 1
                root2 = NULL;
            }
            else if (root1->data > root2->data)
            {
                s2.pop();
                root2 = root2->right;
                root1 = NULL;
            }
        }
        // Both roots and both stacks are empty
        else  break;
    }
    return res;
}
