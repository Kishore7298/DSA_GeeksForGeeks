## Smaller on Right

Given an array arr[] of N elements. The task is to count maximum number of distinct smaller elements on right side of any array element. For example, in {10, 6, 9, 7, 20, 19, 21, 18, 17, 16}, the result is 4. Note that 20 has maximum 4 smaller elements on right side. Other elements have less count, for example 10 has 3 smaller elements on right side.

#### Input:

First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains number of elements in the array and next line contains array elements.

#### Output:

For each testcase, print the maximum count of smaller elements on right side.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
4
10
10 6 9 7 20 19 21 18 17 16
5
5 4 3 2 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 2 1

Output:
4
4
0
2
```

#### Explanation:

Testcase 1: Number of smaller elements on right side of every element (from left to right) in the array are 3 0 1 0 4 3 3 2 1 and 0 respecitvely. Maximum of all these counts is 4.  
Testcase 2: Number of smaller elements on right side of every element (from left to right) in the array are 4 3 2 1 and 0 respecitvely. Maximum of all these counts is 4.

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int arr[1000000];

set<int> s;

int countSmallerRight(int n){

    int countSmaller = 0;

    // iterating over elements
    for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--){
        s.insert(arr[i]);

        // find the first element that is lower than arr[i]
        auto it = s.lower_bound(arr[i]);

        // Find the distance between above found element
        // and the beginning of the set using distance function
        if(distance(s.begin(), it) > countSmaller)
            countSmaller = distance(s.begin(), it);
    }

    return countSmaller;

}


int main(){

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while(t--){
        s.clear();

        int n;
        cin >> n;

        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            cin >> arr[i];
        }

        cout << countSmallerRight(n) << endl;

    }

    return 0;
}
```
