## Find the Closest Element in BST

Given a BST and an integer. Find the least absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the given integer.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
        10
      /   \
     2    11
   /  \
  1    5
      /  \
     3    6
      \
       4
K = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: K=13. The node that has
value nearest to K is 11. so the answer
is 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
      8
    /   \
   1     9
    \     \
     4    10
    /
   3
K = 9
Output: 0
Explanation: K=9. The node that has
value nearest to K is 9. so the answer
is 0.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minDiff() that takes the root of the BST and an integer K as its input and returns the minimum absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the integer K.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(Height of the BST)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of the BST)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100000
```

```c++
/*The Node structure is

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

void minDiffUtil(Node* root, int k, int &diff) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    diff = min(diff, abs(k - (root->data)));
    if(root->data < k) {
        minDiffUtil(root->right, k, diff);
    } else {
        minDiffUtil(root->left, k, diff);
    }
}

// Return the minimum absolute difference between any tree node and the integer K
int minDiff(Node *root, int K)
{
    int diff = abs(K-root->data);
    minDiffUtil(root, K, diff);
    return diff;
}

```
