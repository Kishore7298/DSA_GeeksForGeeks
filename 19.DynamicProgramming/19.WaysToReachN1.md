There are N stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).  
Note: Order does not matter means for `n=4 {1 2 1},{2 1 1},{1 1 2}` are considered same.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: You can reach 4th stair in
3 ways.
3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
You may reach the 5th stair in 3 ways.
The 3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 2
1, 2, 2
```

#### Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function `countWays()` which takes single `argument(N)` and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
```

```c++
// function to count ways to reach mth stair
long long countWays(int n){
    int table[n+1];

    // Initialize all table values as 0
    memset(table, 0, sizeof(table));

    // Base case (If given value is 0)
    table[0] = 1;

    for (int i=1; i<=2; i++)
        for (int j=i; j<=n; j++)
            table[j] = table[j] + table[j-i];

    return table[n];
}

```
