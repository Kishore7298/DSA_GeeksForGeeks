Dynamic Programming

In simple words, it is a optimization over plain recursion.
The idea is to reuse the solution of the subproblem, when there are overlapping subproblems.
1. Memoization(Top Down)
2. Tabulation(Bottom up)

Applications:
1. Bellman Ford Algorithm
2. Floyd warshall Algorithm
3. Diff utility(LCS)
4. Search close words(Edit distance)
5. Resource allocation(0-1 knapsack)
