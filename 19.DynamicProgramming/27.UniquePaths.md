## Number of Unique Paths

Given a A X B matrix with your initial position at the top-left cell, find the number of possible unique paths to reach the bottom-right cell of the matrix from the initial position.

Note: Possible moves can be either down or right at any point in time, i.e., we can move to matrix[i+1][j] or matrix[i][j+1] from matrix[i][j].

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
A = 2, B = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two unique
paths to reach the end of the matrix of
size two from the starting cell of the
matrix.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
A = 3, B = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: There are only 10 unique
paths to reach the end of the matrix of
size two from the starting cell of the
matrix.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete `NumberOfPath()` function which takes 2 arguments(A and B) and returns the number of unique paths from top-left to the bottom-right cell.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(A*B)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(A*B)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ A ≤ 15
1 ≤ B ≤ 15
```

```c++
int NumberOfPath(int m, int n) {
    // Create a 2D table to store results of subproblems
    int count[m][n];

    // Count of paths to reach any cell in first column is 1
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        count[i][0] = 1;

    // Count of paths to reach any cell in first row is 1
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        count[0][j] = 1;

    // Calculate count of paths for other cells in
    // bottom-up manner using the recursive solution
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)

            // By uncommenting the last part the code calculates the total
            // possible paths if the diagonal Movements are allowed
            count[i][j] = count[i - 1][j] + count[i][j - 1]; //+ count[i-1][j-1];
    }
    return count[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```
