## Reach a given score

Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find the number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 8
Output: 1
Explanation:when n = 8,{3,5} and {5,3}
are the two possible permutations but
these represent the same cobmination.
Hence output is 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
n = 20
Output: 4
Explanation:When n = 20, {10,10},
{5,5,5,5},{10,5,5} and {3,3,3,3,3,5}
are different possible permutations.
Hence output will be 4.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete `count()` function which takes N as an argument and returns the number of ways/combinations to reach the given score.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
```

```c++
ll count(ll n) {
    int arr[] = {0, 3, 5, 10};
    vector<vector<ll>> mem(n+1, vector<ll>(4, 0));

    for(int i=0; i<4; i++) {
        mem[0][i] = 1;  // When the sum is zero then it is a proper combination
    }

    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        for(int j=1; j<=3; j++) {
            if(i >= arr[j]) {   // If the current element is less than the sum
                mem[i][j] = mem[i][j-1] + mem[i-arr[j]][j];//Combinations possible by (choosing this element + not choosing)
            } else {
                mem[i][j] = mem[i][j-1];    //Combination possible by not choosing this element
            }
        }
    }

    return mem[n][3];
}
```
