## Kadane's Algorithm - II

You are given an array arr of size sizeOfArr. You need to find the maximum sum in the array provided that you cannot sum neighboring elements or adjacent elements.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
sizeOfArr = 4
arr[] = {4,5,6,7,8}
Output: 18
Explanation:The given elements are 4 5 6 7 8
For 4, the maximum sum will be 4 as no
element other than 4 from index 0 to 0
For 5, the maximum sum will be 5 as we cannot
add 4 and 5(neighboring elements).
For 6, the maximum sum will be 10 as we can
add 6 and 4.
For 7, the maximum sum will be 12 as we can
add 7 and 5.
For 8, the maximum sum will be 18 as we can
add 4 and 6 and 8.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
sizeOfArr = 5
arr[] = {-9,-8,8,3,-4}
Output: 8
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `maximumSum()` that takes array and sizeOfArray and returns the maximum sum of the array provided that you cannot sum neighboring elements.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= sizeOfArr <= 10^3
-10^3 <= arri <= 10^3
```

```c++
long long maximumSum(int arr[], int sizeOfArray)
{
  if(sizeOfArray == 1)
    return arr[0];
  vector<long long> dp(sizeOfArray+1);  // This doesn't stores like naive Kadane's algorithm
  dp[0] = arr[0];                       // This stores maximum sum till that index
  dp[1] = max(dp[0], (long long)arr[1]);
  long long res = dp[1];
  for(int i=2; i<sizeOfArray; i++) {
      /*
        dp[i] = Maximum of
            i) Adding the current element to the non adjacent max sum - If adding two non-negative makes the maximum
            ii) Current element - If the previous max is negative and current element is positive
            iii) Previous max sum - Ignoring the current element, which is possibly negative
      */
      dp[i] = max( dp[i-2] + arr[i],
                    max(
                            (long long)arr[i],
                            dp[i-1]
                        )
                );
      res = max(res, dp[i]);
  }

  return res;
}
```
