## Count ways to reach the n'th stair

There are N stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: You can reach 4th stair in
5 ways.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 10
Output: 89
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `countWays()` which takes the top stair number m as input parameters and returns the `answer % 10^9+7`.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
```

```c++
long long countWays(int m){
    if(m <= 2)
        return m;
    long long prev_prev = 1;    // Previous to previous, intitially for 1th term it is equal to 1
    long long prev = 2; //Previous term, initially, it represents 2nd term
    long long res;  // For storing the final result
    for(int i=3; i<=m; i++) {
        // The Solution is fibonacci series, where the difference is contWays(n) = fib(n+2)
        res = (prev + prev_prev)%1000000007;
        prev_prev = prev;
        prev = res;
    }
    return res;
}
```
