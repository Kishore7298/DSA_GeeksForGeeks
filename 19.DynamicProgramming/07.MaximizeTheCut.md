## Maximize The Cut Segments

Given an integer N denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
x = 5, y = 3, z = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Here total length is 5, and
the cut lengths are 5, 3 and 2. We can
make two segments of lengths 3 and 2.
```

#### Your Task:

You only need to complete the function `maximizeTheCuts()` that takes n, x, y, z as parameters and returns max number cuts.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints
1 <= N, x, y, z <= 10^4
```

```c++
int maximizeTheCuts(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    int dp[n+1];
    dp[0] = 0;  // For rod of length 0, the number of possible cuts are 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        // For rod of length i, what are the number of possible cuts using x, y and z
        dp[i] = -1; // No cuts have been made
        if((i-x) >= 0) {
            // If we make x cut on i, then what is the max cut possible for rod of length i-x
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-x]);
        }
        if((i-y) >= 0) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-y]);
        }
        if((i-z) >= 0) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-z]);
        }
        if(dp[i] != -1) {   // If the cuts have been made
            dp[i]++; // Counting the cut of this iteration
        }
    }
    return dp[n] == -1 ? 0 : dp[n];
}
```
