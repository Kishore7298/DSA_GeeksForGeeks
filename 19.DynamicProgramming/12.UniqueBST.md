## Unique BST's

Given an integer. Find how many structurally unique binary search trees are there that stores the values from 1 to that integer (inclusive).

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:for N = 2, there are 2 unique
BSTs
     1               2
      \            /
       2         1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: for N = 3, there are 5
possible BSTs
  1           3     3       2     1
    \        /     /      /  \     \
     3      2     1      1    3     2
    /      /       \                 \
   2      1         2                 3
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `numTrees()` which takes the integer N as input and returns the total number of Binary Search Trees possible with keys `[1.....N]` inclusive. Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo `1000000007`.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N^2)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1<=N<=1000
```

```c++
// Return the total number of BSTs possible with keys [1....N] inclusive.
long long numTrees(int N) {
    long long mod = 1000000007;
    vector<long long > mem(N+1, 0);
    mem[0] = 1; // When there are 0 nodes then 1 BST is possible
    mem[1] = 1; // When there is 1 node then alse 1 BST is possible

    // res(n) = res(0)*res(n-1) + res(1)*res(n-2) + ....... + res(n-1) * res(0);
    for(int i=2; i<=N; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            mem[i] = (mem[i] + (mem[j]*mem[i-j-1])%mod)%mod;
        }
    }
    return mem[N];
}
```
