## Max sum subarray by removing at most one element

You are given array A of size n. You need to find the maximum-sum sub-array with the condition that you are allowed to skip at most one element.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,-4,5}
Output: 11
Explanation: We can get maximum sum
subarray by skipping -4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
n = 8
A[] = {-2,-3,4,-1,-2,1,5,-3}
Output: 9
Explanation: We can get maximum sum
subarray by skipping -2 as [4,-1,1,5]
sums to 9, which is the maximum
achievable sum.
```

#### Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function maxSumSubarray that take array and size as parameters and returns the maximum sum.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
-10^3 <= Ai<= 10^3
```

```
If element removal condition is not applied, we can solve this problem using Kadane’s algorithm but here one element can be removed also for increasing maximum sum. This condition can be handled using two arrays, forward and backward array, these arrays store the current maximum subarray sum from starting to ith index, and from ith index to ending respectively.
In below code, two loops are written, first one stores maximum current sum in forward direction in fw[] and other loop stores the same in backward direction in bw[]. Getting current maximum and updation is same as Kadane’s algorithm.
Now when both arrays are created, we can use them for one element removal conditions as follows, at each index i, maximum subarray sum after ignoring i’th element will be fw[i-1] + bw[i+1] so we loop for all possible i values and we choose maximum among them.

Total time complexity and space complexity of solution is O(N)
```

```c++
int maxSumSubarray(int A[], int n)
{
    if(n == 1)
        return A[0];
    vector<int> fwd(n), bwd(n);
    fwd[0] = A[0];
    bwd[n-1] = A[n-1];
    int maximum = A[0];
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        fwd[i] = max(A[i] + fwd[i-1], A[i]);
        maximum = max(maximum, fwd[i]);
    }

    for(int i = n-2; i>=0; i--) {
        bwd[i] = max(A[i] + bwd[i+1], A[i]);
    }

    for(int i=2; i<n; i++) {
        maximum = max(maximum, bwd[i] + fwd[i-2]);
    }

    return maximum;
}
```
