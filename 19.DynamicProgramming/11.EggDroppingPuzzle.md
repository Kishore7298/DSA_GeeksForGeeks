## Egg Dropping Puzzle

Suppose you have N eggs and you want to determine from which floor in a K-floor building you can drop an egg such that it doesn't break. You have to determine the minimum number of attempts you need in order find the critical floor in the worst case while using the best strategy.There are few rules given below.

An egg that survives a fall can be used again.  
A broken egg must be discarded.  
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.  
If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.  
If the eggs breaks at a certain floor, it will break at any floor above.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 2, K = 10
Output: 4
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3, K = 5
Output: 3
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `eggDrop()` which takes two positive integer N and K as input parameters and returns the minimum number of attempts you need in order to find the critical floor.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N*K)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N*K)`

```
Constraints:
1<=N<=10
1<=K<=50
```

```c++
/* Function to get minimum number of trials needed in worst
  case with n eggs and k floors */
int eggDrop(int n, int f)
{
    vector<vector<int>> mem(n+1, vector<int>(f+1, INT_MAX));    //mem represents the attempts to check for threshold

    // if the floor is zero or 1 then there can be f attempts
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        mem[i][0] = 0;
        mem[i][1] = 1;
    }

    //If the egg is 1 then the number of attempts are f
    for(int i = 0; i <= f; i++) {
        mem[1][i] = i;
    }

    for(int i=2; i<=n; i++) {   // For i eggs
        for(int j=2; j<=f; j++) {   // For j floors
            for(int x = 1; x <= j; x++) // Trying all the possible x's from 1 to j
            mem[i][j] = min(    // Out of picking the x blocks, which one gives the minimum attempts
                            mem[i][j], //Precomputed
                            max(    //Out of the two below cases, we take the worst case possible by taking the max
                                mem[i][j-x], //If the egg doesn't break, then i eggs remain same, but j floor reduced to j-x
                                mem[i-1][x-1]   //If the egg breaks then the threshold must be within 1..x-1 so, i-1 because egg breaks
                            ) + 1
                        );
        }
    }
    return mem[n][f];
}
```
