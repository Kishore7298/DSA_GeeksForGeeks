## Edit Distance

Given two strings s and t. Find the minimum number of operations that need to be performed on str1 to convert it to str2. The possible operations are:

1. Insert
2. Remove
3. Replace

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
s = "geek", t = "gesek"
Output: 1
Explanation: One operation is required
inserting 's' between two 'e's of str1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input :
s = "gfg", t = "gfg"
Output:
0
Explanation: Both strings are same.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `editDistance()` which takes strings s and t as input parameters and returns the minimum number of operation required to make both strings equal.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(n2)`
Expected Space Complexity: `O(n2)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= Length of both strings <= 100
Both the strings are in lowercase.
```

```c++
int editDistanceUtil(string s, string t, int m, int n, vector<vector<int>> &mem) {
	        if(mem[m][n] != -1)
	            return mem[m][n];
	        if(m == 0)
	            return mem[m][n] = n;
	        if(n == 0)
	            return mem[m][n] = m;
	        if(s[m-1] == t[n-1])
	            return mem[m][n] = editDistanceUtil(s, t, m-1, n-1, mem);
	        else {
	            return mem[m][n] = 1 + min(
	                                       editDistanceUtil(s, t, m-1, n, mem), // This is for insert
	                                   min(
	                                       editDistanceUtil(s,t, m, n-1, mem), // This is for delete
	                                       editDistanceUtil(s, t, m-1, n-1, mem)    // This is for replace
	                                   ));
	        }
}

int editDistance(string s, string t) {
    // edit s to t
    int m = s.length();
    int n = t.length();
    vector<vector<int>> mem(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, -1));
    return editDistanceUtil(s, t, m, n, mem);
}
```
