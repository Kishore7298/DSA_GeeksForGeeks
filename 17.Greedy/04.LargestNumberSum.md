## Largest number with given sum

A boy lost the password of his super locker. He remembers the number of digits N as well as the sum S of all the digits of his password. He know that his password is the largest number of N digits that can be possible with given sum S. As he is busy doing his homework, help him retrieving his password.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5, S = 12
Output: 93000
Explanation: Sum of elements is 12.
Largest possible 5 digit number is 93000.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3, S = 29
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such three digit
number whose sum is 29.
```

#### Your Task :

Complete the function `largestnumber()` that returns the largest possible strings as answer, `-1` otherwise.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
0 <= S <= 106
```

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```c++
// Function to return Largest Number
string largestNumber(int n, int sum){
    int maxNumber = 9;
    string res;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        if(sum < maxNumber) {
            maxNumber = sum;
            res += to_string(maxNumber);
            sum = 0;
        } else if(sum == 0) {
            res += "0";
        } else {
            sum -= maxNumber;
            res += to_string(maxNumber);
        }
    }
    if(sum != 0)
        return "-1";
    return res;
}
```
