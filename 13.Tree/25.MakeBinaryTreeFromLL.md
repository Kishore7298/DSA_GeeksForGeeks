## Make Binary Tree From Linked List

Given a Linked List Representation of Complete Binary Tree. The task is to construct the Binary tree.
Note : The complete binary tree is represented as a linked list in a way where if root node is stored at position i, its left, and right children are stored at position `2*i+1, 2*i+2` respectively.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
K = 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: The tree would look like
      1
    /   \
   2     3
 /  \
4   5
Now, the level order traversal of
the above tree is 1 2 3 4 5.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
K = 5->4->3->2->1
Output: 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: The tree would look like
     5
   /  \
  4    3
 / \
2    1
Now, the level order traversal of
the above tree is 5 4 3 2 1.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function convert() which takes head of linked list and root of the tree as the reference. The driver code prints the level order.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= Ki <= 10^3
```

```c++
/*
The structure of Link list Node is as follows
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct node* next;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
The structure of TreeNode is as follows
struct TreeNode
{
    int data;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
};
*/

/*You are required to complete this method*/
void convert(Node *head, TreeNode *&root) {
    if(head == NULL)
        return;
    queue<TreeNode *> q;
    TreeNode* first = new TreeNode(head->data);
    root = first;
    Node *temp = head->next;
    q.push(first);
    while(temp != NULL) {
        TreeNode* elem = q.front();
        q.pop();
        // Add the left element
        TreeNode* left = new TreeNode(temp->data);
        elem->left = left;
        q.push(left);
        temp = temp->next;
        //Add the right element
        if(temp != NULL) {
            TreeNode* right = new TreeNode(temp->data);
            elem->right = right;
            q.push(right);
            temp = temp->next;
        }
    }
}
```
