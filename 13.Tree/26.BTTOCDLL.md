## Binary Tree to CDLL

Given a Binary Tree of N edges. The task is to convert this to a Circular Doubly Linked List(CDLL) in-place. The left and right pointers in nodes are to be used as previous and next pointers respectively in converted CDLL. The order of nodes in CDLL must be same as Inorder of the given Binary Tree. The first node of Inorder traversal (left most node in BT) must be head node of the CDLL.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
      1
    /   \
   3     2
Output:
3 1 2
2 1 3
Explanation: After converting tree to CDLL
when CDLL is is traversed from head to
tail and then tail to head, elements
are displayed as in the output.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
     10
   /    \
  20    30
 /  \
40  60
Output:
40 20 60 10 30
30 10 60 20 40
Explanation:After converting tree to CDLL,
when CDLL is is traversed from head to
tail and then tail to head, elements
are displayed as in the output.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to take input. Complete the function `bTreeToCList()` that takes root as a parameter and returns the head of the list. The printing is done by the driver code.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= Data of a node <= 10^4
```

Expected time complexity: `O(N)`

Expected auxiliary space: `O(h)` , where h = height of tree

#### My Approach:

```c++
/*Complete the function below
Node is as follows:
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};*/

Node* previ = NULL;
Node* head = NULL;
void bTreeToCListUtil(Node *root) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    bTreeToCListUtil(root->left);
    if(previ == NULL) {
        previ = root;
        head = root;
    } else  {
        previ->right = root;
        root->left = previ;
        previ = root;
    }
    bTreeToCListUtil(root->right);
}

Node *bTreeToCList(Node *root)
{
    previ = NULL;
    head = NULL;
    bTreeToCListUtil(root);
    previ->right = head;
    head->left = previ;
    return head;
}
```

#### Solution from editorial

`Hint 1: `

```
1. The idea can be described using below steps.
1) Write a general purpose function that concatenates two given circular doubly lists (This function is explained below).
2) Now traverse the given tree
….a) Recursively convert left subtree to a circular DLL. Let the converted list be leftList.
….a) Recursively convert right subtree to a circular DLL. Let the converted list be rightList.
….c) Make a circular linked list of root of the tree, make left and right of root to point to itself.
….d) Concatenate leftList with list of single root node.
….e) Concatenate the list produced in step above (d) with rightList.
```

`Hint 2:`

```
2. How to Concatenate two circular DLLs?

Get the last node of the left list. Retrieving the last node is an O(1) operation, since the prev pointer of the head points to the last node of the list.
Connect it with the first node of the right list
Get the last node of the second list
Connect it with the head of the list.
```

`Code :`

```c++
Node *concatenate(Node *leftList, Node *rightList)
{
    // If either of the list is empty
    // then return the other list
    if (leftList == NULL)
        return rightList;
    if (rightList == NULL)
        return leftList;

    // Store the last Node of left List
    Node *leftLast = leftList->left;

    // Store the last Node of left List
    Node *rightLast = rightList->left;

    // Store the last Node of left List
    leftLast->right = rightList;
    rightList->left = leftLast;

    // Store the last Node of left List
    leftList->left = rightLast;

    // Store the last Node of left List
    rightLast->right = leftList;
    return leftList;
}

Node *bTreeToCList(Node *root)
{
    if (root == NULL)
        return NULL;

    Node *left = bTreeToCList(root->left);
    Node *right = bTreeToCList(root->right);

    // Make a circular linked list of single node
    // (or root). To do so, make the right and
    // left pointers of this node point to itself
    root->left = root->right = root;

    // Step 1 (concatenate the left list with the list
    //         with single node, i.e., current node)
    // Step 2 (concatenate the returned list with the
    //         right List)
    return concatenate(concatenate(left, root), right);
}
```
