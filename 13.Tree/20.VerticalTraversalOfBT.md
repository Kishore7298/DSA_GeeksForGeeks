## Vertical Traversal of Binary Tree

Given a Binary Tree, find the vertical traversal of it starting from the leftmost level to the rightmost level.
If there are multiple nodes passing through a vertical line, then they should be printed as they appear in level order traversal of the tree.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
     2
      \
       3
      /
     4
Output: 2 4 3
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
       1
    /    \
   2      3
 /   \      \
4     5      6
Output: 4 2 1 5 3 6
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `verticalOrder()` which takes the root node as input and returns an array containing the vertical order traversal of the tree from the leftmost to the rightmost level. If 2 nodes lie in the same vertical level, they should be printed in the order they appear in the level order traversal of the tree.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 5000
```

```c++
/* A binary tree node has data, pointer to left child
   and a pointer to right child
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
 */

// root: root node of the tree
vector<int> verticalOrder(Node *root)
{
    vector<int> res;    // Final resultant vector
    if(root == NULL)
        return res;
    map<int, vector<int>> mp;  // stores HD(horizotal distance from root), list of nodes with same HD
    queue<pair<Node *, int>> q; // Holds Node and HD
    q.push(make_pair(root, 0));
    while(q.empty() != true) {
        pair<Node *, int> p= q.front();
        q.pop();
        Node * curr = p.first;
        int hd = p.second;
        mp[hd].push_back(curr->data);
        if(curr->left != NULL) {
            q.push(make_pair(curr->left, hd-1));    // -ve HD for left
        }
        if(curr->right != NULL) {
            q.push(make_pair(curr->right, hd+1));   // +ve HD for right
        }
    }
    for(auto i: mp) {   // map stores the key in Ascending order
        for(auto j: i.second) {
            res.push_back(j);
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
