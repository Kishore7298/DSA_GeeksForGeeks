Given a Binary Tree, you need to find the maximum value which you can get by subtracting the value of node B from the value of node A, where A and B are two nodes of the binary tree and A is an ancestor of B.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
    5
 /    \
2      1
Output: 4
Explanation:The maximum difference we can
get is 4, which is bewteen 5 and 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
      1
    /    \
   2      3
           \
            7
Output: -1
Explanation:The maximum difference we can
get is -1, which is between 1 and 2.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `maxDiff()` which finds the maximum difference between the node and its ancestor.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(H)`.  
Note: H is the height of the tree.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of edges <= 10^4
0 <= Data of a node <= 10^5
```

```c++
int maxDiffUtil(Node *t,int *res)
{
    /* Returning Maximum int value if node is not
       there (one child case)  */
    if (t == NULL)
        return INT_MAX;

    /* If leaf node then just return node's value  */
    if (t->left == NULL && t->right == NULL)
        return t->data;

    /* Recursively calling left and right subtree
       for minimum value  */
    int val = min(maxDiffUtil(t->left, res),
                  maxDiffUtil(t->right, res));

    /* Updating res if (node value - minimum value
       from subtree) is bigger than res  */
    *res = max(*res, t->data - val);

    /* Returning minimum value got so far */
    return min(val, t->data);
}

int maxDiff(Node *root)
{
    int res=INT_MIN;
    maxDiffUtil(root,&res);
    return res;
}
```
