## Binary Tree to DLL

Given a Binary Tree (BT), convert it to a Doubly Linked List(DLL) In-Place. The left and right pointers in nodes are to be used as previous and next pointers respectively in converted DLL. The order of nodes in DLL must be same as Inorder of the given Binary Tree. The first node of Inorder traversal (leftmost node in BT) must be the head node of the DLL.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
      1
    /  \
   3    2
Output:
3 1 2
2 1 3
Explanation: DLL would be 3<=>1<=>2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
       10
      /   \
     20   30
   /   \
  40   60
Output:
40 20 60 10 30
30 10 60 20 40
Explanation:  DLL would be
40<=>20<=>60<=>10<=>30.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to take input. Complete the function `bToDLL()` that takes root node of the tree as a parameter and returns the head of DLL . The driver code prints the DLL both ways.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(H)`.
Note: H is the height of the tree and this space is used implicitly for recursion stack.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 1000
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000
```

```c++
/* Structure for tree and linked list

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
 */

// This function should return head to the DLL
Node* previous = NULL;  // This is where the linkedlist is formed (holds the pointer to the last elem)
Node* BTTODLL(Node* root) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return root;
    Node* head  = BTTODLL(root->left);
    if(previous == NULL)    // Head has role only for this case
        head= root;
    else {  // attaching the element to the previous
        root->left = previous;
        previous->right = root;
    }
    previous = root;
    BTTODLL(root->right);
    return head;
}

Node * bToDLL(Node *root)
{
    previous = NULL;    //Clearing up for the test cases
    return BTTODLL(root);
}
```
