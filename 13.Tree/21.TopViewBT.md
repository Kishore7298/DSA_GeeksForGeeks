## Top View of Binary Tree

Given below is a binary tree. The task is to print the top view of binary tree. Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. For the given below tree

```
       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    /   \
4    5  6   7
```

Top view will be: 4 2 1 3 7
Note: Print from leftmost node to rightmost node.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
      1
   /    \
  2      3
Output: 2 1 3
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
       10
    /      \
  20        30
 /   \    /    \
40   60  90    100
Output: 40 20 10 30 100
```

#### Your Task:

Since this is a function problem. You don't have to take input. Just complete the function `printTopView()` that takes root node as parameter and prints the top view. The newline is automatically appended by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Node Data <= 10^5
```

```c++
//Structure of binary tree
/*struct Node
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};*/
// function should print the topView of the binary tree
void topView(struct Node *root)
{
    if(root == NULL)
        return;
    queue<pair<Node *, int>> q;
    map<int, vector<int>> mp;
    q.push(make_pair(root, 0));
    while(q.empty() != true) {
        pair<Node *, int> p = q.front();
        q.pop();
        Node *curr = p.first;
        int hd = p.second;
        mp[hd].push_back(curr->data);
        if(curr->left != NULL) {
            q.push(make_pair(curr->left, hd-1));
        }
        if(curr->right != NULL) {
            q.push(make_pair(curr->right, hd+1));
        }
    }
    for(auto i: mp) {
        cout<<i.second[0]<<" ";
    }
}

```
