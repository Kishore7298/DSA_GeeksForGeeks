## Primality Test

For a given number N check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
Output: Yes
Explanation: 5 is a prime number.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 4
Output: No
Explanation: 4 is not a prime number.
```

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPrime() that takes N as parameter and returns True if N is prime else returns false.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N1/2)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 109
```

```c++
bool isPrime(int N)
{
    if(N==1) //1 is not prime so return false
    return false;

    for(int i=2;i<=sqrt(N);i++) //We check from 2 from sqrt(N) as divisors, if any, would exist till sqrt(N)
    {
        if(N%i==0) //If any i divides the number this means the nubmer is not prime
        return false;
    }
    return true; //return true in other cases
}
```
