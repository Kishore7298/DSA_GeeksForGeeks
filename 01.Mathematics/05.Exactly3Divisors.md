## Exactly 3 Divisors

Given a positive integer value N. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to N have numbers of divisors exactly equal to 3.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only number with
3 divisor is 4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 10
Output: 2
Explanation: 4 and 9 have 3 divisors.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `exactly3Divisors()` that takes N as parameter and returns count of numbers less than or equal to N with exactly 3 divisors.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N1/2 * N1/4)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 109
```

```c++
// function to check if n is prime
bool isPrime(int n)
{
    if(n<=1)
    return false;

    for(int i=2;i<=sqrt(n);i++)
    if(n%i==0)
    return false;

    return true ;
}

int exactly3Divisors(int N)
{
    int counter=0; //Initializing counter to zero
    N = sqrt(N);

    for(int i=1;i<=N;i++) //running a loop from 1 to N
    {
        // A number N only has 3 divisors if it is a perfect square and its square root is a prime number,
        //  and we know the number of perfect squares less than N which is sqrt(N),
        // so just checking if i is prime or not
        if(isPrime(i))
        counter++;
    }
    return counter;
}
```
