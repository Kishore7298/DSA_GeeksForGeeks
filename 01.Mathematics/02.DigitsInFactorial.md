## Digits In Factorial

Given an integer N. The task is to find the number of digits that appear in its factorial, where factorial is defined as, `factorial(n) = 1*2*3*4……..*N` and `factorial(0) = 1`.

Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Factorial of 5 is 120.
Number of digits in 120 is 3 (1, 2, and 0)
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 120
Output: 199
Explanation: The number of digits in
200! is 199
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function digitsInFactorial() that takes N as parameter and returns number of digits in factorial of N.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
```

```c++
int digitsInFactorial(int N)
{
    double sum=0.0; //to store the sum of log n +log (n-1)+...
    for(int j=1;j<=N;j++)
    {
        sum+=log10(j);

    }
    return(1+floor(sum));
}

```
