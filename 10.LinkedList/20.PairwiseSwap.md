## Pairwise swap of nodes in LinkeList

Given a linked list of N positive integers. You need to swap elements pairwise. Your task is to complete the function `pairwise_swap()`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 7
value[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
Output: 2 1 4 3 6 5 7
Explanation:The linked list after swapping
becomes: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -> 2 1 4 3 6 5 7.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 6
value[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Output: 2 1 4 3 6 5
Explanation:The linked list after swapping
becomes: 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 2 1 4 3 6 5.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to worry about input and output, you just have to complete the function `pairwise_swap()`. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

```
Constraint:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Node values <= 1000
```

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```c++
/*
struct Node {
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
  Node(int x) {
    data = x;
    next = NULL;
  }
};
*/
struct Node* pairwise_swap(struct Node* head)
{
    if(head == NULL || head->next  == NULL)
        return head;
    Node* prev = head;
    Node* curr = head->next->next;
    head->next->next = head;
    head = head->next;
    while(curr != NULL && curr->next != NULL) {
        prev->next = curr->next;
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr->next->next;
        prev->next->next = prev;
    }
    prev->next = curr;
    return head;
}
```
