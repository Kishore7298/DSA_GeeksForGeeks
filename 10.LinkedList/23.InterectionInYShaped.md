## Intersection Point in Y Shapped Linked Lists

Given two singly linked lists of size N and M, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkList1 = 3->6->9->common
LinkList2 = 10->common
common = 15->30->NULL
Output: 15
Explanation:
Y ShapedLinked List
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function `intersetPoint()` which takes the pointer to the head of linklist1 and linklist2 as input parameters and returns data value of a node where two linked lists intersect. If linked list do not merge at any point, then it should return `-1`.  
Challenge : Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N+M)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= value <= 1000
```

```c++
/* Linked List Node
struct Node {
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
  Node(int x) {
    data = x;
    next = NULL;
  }
}; */

/* Should return data of intersection point of two linked
   lists head1 and head2.
   If there is no intersecting point, then return -1. */
int intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2)
{
    Node* curr = head1;
    int length1 = 0;
    while(curr != NULL) {
        curr = curr->next;
        length1++;
    }
    curr = head2;
    int length2 = 0;
    while(curr!= NULL) {
        curr = curr->next;
        length2++;
    }
    int length = abs(length1 - length2);
    if(length1 >= length2) {
        curr = head1;
        while(length--) {
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        Node* sec = head2;
        while(sec != NULL && curr != NULL) {
            if(sec == curr) {
                return curr->data;
            }
            sec = sec->next;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    } else if (length2 > length1) {
        curr = head2;
        while(length--) {
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        Node* sec = head1;
        while(sec != NULL && curr != NULL) {
            if(sec == curr) {
                return curr->data;
            }
            sec = sec->next;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
