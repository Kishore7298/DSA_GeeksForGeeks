## Swap Kth nodes from ends

Given a singly linked list of size N, and an integer K. You need to swap the Kth node from beginning and Kth node from the end in the linked list.
Note: You need to swap the nodes through the links and not changing the content of the nodes.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4,  K = 1
value[] = {1,2,3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: Here K = 1, hence after
swapping the 1st node from the beginning
and end thenew list will be 4 2 3 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5,  K = 3
value[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 1
Explanation: Here k = 3, hence after
swapping the 3rd node from the beginning
and end the new list will be 1 2 3 4 5.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `swapkthnode()`, which has arguments head, num(no of nodes), and K, and it should return a new head. The validation is done internally by the driver code to ensure that the swapping is done by changing references/pointers only. A correct code would always cause output as 1.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(n)`  
Expected Auxillary space Complexity: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= K <= 103
```

```c++
/* Linked List Node structure
   struct Node  {
     int data;
     Node *next;
     Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
  }
  }

// Should swap Kth node from beginning and Kth
// node from end in list and return new head.
Node *swapkthnode(Node* head, int num, int K)
{
    if(num == 1 || K > num) {   // If the number of nodes is one or if k is greater than number of nodes
        return head;
    }

    if(K==1 || K == num) {  // Last node needs to be swapped with first
        Node* firstNode = head;
        Node* secondNode = head;
        for(int i=0; i<num-2; i++) {
            secondNode = secondNode->next;
        }
        if(num == 2) {  // If there are only two nodes then just reverse the list

            return temp;
        }
    } else {
        int count = 0;
        Node* firstNode =head; // first node points to the previous node of first node which needs to be swapped
        for(int i=0; i<K-2; i++) {
            firstNode = firstNode->next;
        }

            secondNode = secondNode->next;
        }
        if(abs(num-K-K+1) == 1) { // If the nodes which needs to be swapped are adjacent to each other
             Node* first = firstNode->next;
             Node* second = secondNode->next;
             firstNode->next = second;
             first->next = second->next;
             second->next = first;
        } else {
