## Delete middle element of a stack

Given a stack with push(), pop(), empty() operations, delete the middle of the stack without using any additional data structure.
Middle: ceil(size_of_stack/2.0)

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
Stack = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1, 2, 4, 5}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 5 ,
hence the middle element will be the 3rd
element which is deleted
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
Stack = {1 2 3 4}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1 3 4}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 4 ,
hence the middle element will be the 2nd
element which is deleted
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `deleteMid()` which takes the stack and its size as input parameters and modifies the stack in-place.
Note: The output shows the stack from top to bottom.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
2 <= size of stack <= 100
```

```c++
//You need to complete this function
stack<int> deleteMid(stack<int>s,int sizeOfStack,int current) {
    int topElement = s.top();
    s.pop();
    int midIndex = ((sizeOfStack)/2) == current;
    if(midIndex) {
        return s;
    }
    stack<int> midRemoved = deleteMid(s, sizeOfStack, current+1);
    midRemoved.push(topElement);
    return midRemoved;
}
```
