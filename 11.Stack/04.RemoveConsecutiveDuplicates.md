## Removing consecutive duplicates

Stacks can be used to remove duplicate characters from a string that are stacked next to each other. For example, we take the string aabbccccc and convert it into abc. We can push the first character into a stack and skip if the top of the stack is equal to the current character.

You are given string str. You need to remove the consecutive duplicates from the given string using a Stack.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
aaaaaabaabccccccc

Output:
ababc

Explanation:
Removing all consecutive duplicates,
we have no duplicates consecutively.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
abbccbcd

Output:
abcbcd

Explanation:
Removing all the consecutive duplicates,
we have the output as abcbcd.
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You need to complete the function `removeConsecutiveDuplicates()` that takes a string as a parameter and returns the modified string. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 10^3
```

```c++
string removeConsecutiveDuplicates(string s) {
    stack<char> st;
    for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
        if(st.empty()) {
            st.push(s[i]);
        } else {
            if(st.top() != s[i])
                st.push(s[i]);
        }
    }
    string ans = "";
    while(!st.empty()) {
        ans = st.top() + ans;
        st.pop();
    }
    return ans;
}
```
