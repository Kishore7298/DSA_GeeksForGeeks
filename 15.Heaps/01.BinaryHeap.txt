Binary Heap

1. Used in Heap sort
2. Used to implement priority queue
3. Two types
    - Min Heap: Highest priority item is assigned lowest value.
    - Max Heap: Highest priority item is assigned highest value.

Binary Heap is a complete binary tree (stored as an array)
Note: complete binary tree is a binary tree where all the levels are filled with nodes except,
      Possibly the last level, and the last level is filled from left to right.

Example:
        10
       /  \
     20   30
    / \   /
   40 50 60

Array representation: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

left(i) = 2i+1 // left node of the ith node can be found at 2i+1 th index
right(i) = 2i+2 // Right node of the ith node can be found at 2i+2 th index
parent(i) = floor((i-1)/2) // parent of ith node can be found at (i-1)/2 th index.

Ex: left(1) = 3
    right(1) = 4
    parent(5) = 2

Maximum number of nodes at height h:
ceil(n/(2^(h+1))); // n is the number of nodes and h is the height of the level(for leaf nodes it's 0)

Applications:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Prim's Algorithm
3. Huffman coding
4. Heap sort
