## Merge k Sorted Arrays

Given K sorted arrays arranged in the form of a matrix of size K\*K. The task is to merge them into one sorted array.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
K = 3
arr[][] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Explanation:Above test case has 3 sorted
arrays of size 3, 3, 3
arr[][] = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9]]
The merged list will be
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
K = 4
arr[][]={{1,2,3,4}{2,2,3,4},
         {5,5,6,6},{7,8,9,9}}
Output:
1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 8 9 9
Explanation: Above test case has 4 sorted
arrays of size 4, 4, 4, 4
arr[][] = [[1, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 4, 4],
[5, 5, 6, 6]  [7, 8, 9, 9 ]]
The merged list will be
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5,
6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 ].
```

#### Your Task:

You need to complete `mergeKArrays()` function which takes 2 arguments, an `arr[k][k]` 2D Matrix containing k sorted arrays and an integer k denoting the number of sorted arrays. The function should return the merged sorted array ( as a pointer to the merged sorted arrays in cpp, as an `ArrayList<Integer>` in java, and list in python)

Expected Time Complexity: `O(nk Logk)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(k)`

Note: This space is required for returning the resulted sorted array, other work should be done in O(K) Auxiliary Space.

```
Constraints:
1 <= K <= 100
```

```c++
// your task is tocomplete this function
// function should return an pointer to output array int*
// of size k*k
int *mergeKArrays(int arr[][N], int k) {
    int *a = new int[k*k];
    int track[k] = {0}; // This array keeps track of the column count (to push the lowest) for every row.
    int index = 0;  // Index count for the final sorted array.
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq; // stores <value, index>
    for(int i = 0; i<k; i++) {
        pq.push({arr[i][0], i});    // Pushing the first column elements
    }
    while(pq.empty() != true) {
        auto elem = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        int element = elem.first;
        int ind = elem.second;  // as this row has the smallest, element of this row will be pushed
        a[index++] = element;
        track[ind]++;
        if(track[ind] < k) {    // To check if the row has reached the end.
            pq.push({arr[ind][track[ind]], ind});
        }
    }
    return a;
}
```
