## Stock buy and sell

The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 7
A[] = {100,180,260,310,40,535,695}
Output: (0 3) (4 6)
Explanation: We can buy stock on day
0, and sell it on 3rd day, which will
give us maximum profit. Now, we buy
stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {4,2,2,2,4}
Output: (3 4)
Explanation: We can buy stock on day
3, and sell it on 4th day, which will
give us maximum profit.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `stockBuySell()` which takes an array `price[]` and `N` as a parameter and finds the days of buying and selling stock and print them. And if there is no profit then print "No Profit". The newline is automatically added by the driver code.

Note: Output format is as follows -
`(buy_day sell_day) (buy_day sell_day)`

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
2 <= N <= 103
0 <= Ai <= 104
```

```c++
// This function finds the buy sell schedule for maximum profit
void stockBuySell(int a[], int n)
{
    vector<pair<int, int>> days;
    int i = 0;
    while(i+1 <n && a[i]>=a[i+1]) { //This handles when the first buy is made.
        i++;
    }
    if(i+1 >= n) {
        cout<<"No Profit";
        return;
    }
    int dayBought = i;  //Bought index value
    bool dayExists = true;  //Holds true when bought and not sold
    for(i; i<n; i++) {
        if(a[i] > a[i+1]) { //Next index has lesser value
            days.push_back({dayBought, i}); // So mapping with bought day and pushing it.
            dayExists = false;  //Bought and sold
            i++;
            while(i+1 <n && a[i]>=a[i+1]) { //Till we find the next increment in price
                i++;
            }
            if(i+1 >= n)
                break;  //If we couldn't find the next increment in price
            dayBought = i;  //if Found, then buying the stock in the current index.
            dayExists = true;

        }
    }
    if(dayExists == true) { //If the Stock is bought and not sold, then mapping it with the last index
        days.push_back({dayBought, n-1});
    }
    if(days.size() == 0) {
        cout<<"No Profit";
        return;
    }
    for(auto i: days) {
        cout<<"("<<i.first<<" "<<i.second<<")"<<" ";
    }
}
```
