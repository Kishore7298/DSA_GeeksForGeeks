## Leaders in an array

Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.

Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: The first leader is 17
as it is greater than all the elements
to its right.  Similarly, the next
leader is 5. The right most element
is always a leader so it is also
included.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,4,0}
Output: 4 0
Explanation: 4 and 0 are leaders.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function leader() which returns an array of leaders in same order as they appear in the array. The printing is automatically done by driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= Ai <= 10^7
```

```c++
void reverse(vector<int> &a) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = a.size()-1;
    while(low < high) {
        swap(a[low++], a[high--]);
    }
}
// Function to find the leaders in an array of size n
vector<int> leaders(int arr[], int n){
    vector<int> lead = {arr[n-1]};
    int max = arr[n-1];
    for(int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if(arr[i] >= max) {
            lead.push_back(arr[i]);
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    reverse(lead);
    return lead;
}
```
