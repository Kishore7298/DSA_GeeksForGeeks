## Longest Subarray Of Evens And Odds

You are given an array of size n. Find the maximum possible length of a subarray such that its elements are arranged alternately either as even and odd or odd and even.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 5
a[] = {10,12,14,7,8}
Output: 3
Explanation: The max length of subarray
is 3 and the subarray is {14 7 8}. Here
the array starts as an even element and
has odd and even elements alternately.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
n = 2
a[] = {4,6}
Output: 1
Explanation: The array contains {4 6}.
So, we can only choose 1 element as
that will be the max length subarray.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to take any input. Just complete the function `maxEvenOdd()` that returns the maximum length.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 103
1 <= Ai <= 103
```

```c++
//This is also based on Kadane's algorithm.
//Swifting until the subsequence ends, upon ending creating a new subsequence.
int maxEvenOdd(int arr[], int n)
{
   int maxi = 1;
   int curr = 1;
   for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
       bool isAlternating = (arr[i-1]%2 == 0 && arr[i]%2 != 0) || (arr[i-1]%2 != 0 && arr[i]%2 == 0);
       if(isAlternating) {
           curr++;
           if(curr > maxi)
            maxi = curr;
       } else
        curr = 1;
   }
   return maxi;
}
```
