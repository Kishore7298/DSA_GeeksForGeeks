## Maximum occured integer

Given N integer ranges, the task is to find the maximum occurring integer in these ranges. If more than one such integer exits, find the smallest one. The ranges are given as two arrays `L[]` and `R[]`. `L[i]` consists of starting point of range and `R[i]` consists of corresponding end point of the range.

```
For example consider the following ranges.
L[] = {2, 1, 3}, R[] = {5, 3, 9)
Ranges represented by above arrays are.
[2, 5] = {2, 3, 4, 5}
[1, 3] = {1, 2, 3}
[3, 9] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The maximum occurred integer in these ranges is 3.
```

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
L[] = {1,4,3,1}
R[] = {15,8,5,4}
Output: 4
Explanation: The given ranges are [1,15]
 [4, 8] [3, 5] [1, 4]. The number that
is most common or appears most times in
the ranges is 4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
L[] = {1,5,9,13,21}
R[] = {15,8,12,20,30}
Output: 5
Explanation: The given ranges are
[1,15] [5, 8] [9, 12] [13, 20]
[21, 30]. The number that is most
common or appears most times in
the ranges is 5.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `maxOccured()` which returns the maximum occured integer in all ranges.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
0 <= L[i], R[i] <= 106
```

```
Hint:
We create an array arr[] of size 1000000 (limit given on maximum value of an interval). The idea is to add +1 to each Li index and -1 to corresponding Ri index in arr[]. After this, find the prefix sum of the array. Adding +1 at Li shows the starting point of ith Range and adding -1 shows the ending point of ith range. Finally we return the array index that has maximum prefix sum
```

```c++
// L and R are input array
// maxx : maximum in R[]
// n: size of array
// arr[] : declared globally with size equal to maximum in L[] and R[]
int maxOccured(int L[], int R[], int n, int maxx){
    int track[maxx+2] = {0};
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        track[L[i]]++;
        track[R[i]+1]--;
    }
    int maxi = 1;
    int elem = L[0];
    for(int i=1; i<maxx+2; i++) {
        track[i] += track[i-1];
        if(track[i] > maxi) {
            maxi = track[i];
            elem = i;
        }
    }
    return elem;
}
```
