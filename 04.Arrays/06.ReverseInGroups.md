## Reverse array in groups

Given an array `arr[]` of positive integers of size `N`. Reverse every sub-array of `K` group elements.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 2 1 5 4
Explanation: Reversing groups in size
k = 3, first group consists of elements
1, 2, 3. Reversing this group, we have
elements in order as 3, 2, 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 4, K = 3
arr[] = {5,6,8,9}
Output: 8 6 5 9
Explanation: Our array is 5 6 8 9.
The value of k is 3. So we reverse
it in groups of 3.  After reversing,
it becomes 8 6 5 9.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `reverseInGroups()` which reverses elements of the array in groups and returns the array. The printing of array is done by drivercode.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N, K ≤ 107
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1018
```

```c++
void reverse(vector<long long> &a, int low, int high) {
    while(high >= low) {
        swap(a[low++], a[high--]);
    }
}

// Function to reverse the array in groups
vector<long long> reverseInGroups(vector<long long> mv, int n, int k){
    if(k> n) {
      reverse(mv, 0, n-1);
    }
    int low = 0;    //Reversing from low to high
    int high = k-1;
    while(high < n) {
        reverse(mv, low, high);
        low = high+1;
        high = low + k-1;
        if(low < n && high >= n) {
            //This is for the last elements which are less than k but needs to be swapped
            reverse(mv, low, n-1);
        }
    }
    return mv;
}
```
