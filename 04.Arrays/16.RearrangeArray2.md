## Rearrange an array with O(1) extra space

Given an array `arr[]` of size `N` where every element is in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Rearrange the given array so that `arr[i]` becomes `arr[arr[i]]`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {1,0}
Output: 0 1
Explanation: arr[0] = 1 and arr[arr[0]]
= 0.Also, arr[1] = 0 and arr[arr[1]] = 1.
So, rearranging elements, we get array
as, 0 1.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4,0,2,1,3}
Output: 3 4 2 0 1
Explanation: arr[0] = 4 and arr[arr[0]]
= 3. Also, arr[1] = 0 and arr[arr[1]]
= 4 and so on. So, rearranging elements,
we get array as 3 4 2 0 1.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `arrange()` which arranges the elements in the array. The printing is done automatically done by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= Arr[i] < N
```

```c++
void arrange(long long arr[], int n) {
    int maxx = n;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        arr[i] += (arr[arr[i]]%maxx)*maxx;
    }
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        arr[i] /= n;
}
```
