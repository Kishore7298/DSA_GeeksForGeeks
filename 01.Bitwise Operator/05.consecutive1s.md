## Longest Consecutive 1's
Given a number N. The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

#### Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N.

#### Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the length of the longest consecutive 1's in N's binary representation.

#### User Task:
The task is to complete the function maxConsecutiveOnes() which returns the length of longest consecutive 1s in the binary representation of given N.
```
Constraints:
1 <= T < 100
1 <= N <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
14
222

Output:
3 
4

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Binary representation of 14 is 1110, in which 111 is the longest consecutive set bits of length is 3.
Testcase 2: Binary representation of  222 is 11011110, in which 1111 is the longest consecutive set bits of length 4.
```

#### Solution:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//User function Template for C++

/*  Function to calculate the largest consecutive ones
*   x: given input to calculate the largest consecutive ones
*/
int maxConsecutiveOnes(int x)
{
    int max = 0;
    int maxSoFar = 0;
    while(x>0) {
        if(x&1 != 0) {
            maxSoFar++;
        } else {
            maxSoFar = 0;
        }
        if(maxSoFar > max) {
            max = maxSoFar;
        }
        x = x>>1;
    }
    
    return max;
}

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		int n;
		cin>>n;
		cout<<maxConsecutiveOnes(n)<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}  
```
