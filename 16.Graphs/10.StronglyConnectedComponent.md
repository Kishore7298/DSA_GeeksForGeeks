## Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algo)

Given a graph with N nodes and M directed edges. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju() which returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the graph.

#### Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers N and M. In the next line there are M space-separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v.

#### Output:

For each test case in a new line output will an integer denoting the no of strongly connected components present in the graph.

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `kosaraju()` which takes the number of vertices V and adjacency list of the graph as inputs and returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the given graph.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N + M)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5000
0 <= M <= (N*(N-1))
0 <= u, v <= N-1
Sum of M over all testcases will not exceed 25*106
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
2
5 5
1 0 0 2 2 1 0 3 3 4
3 3
0 1 1 2 2 0

Output:
3
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1:
There is a connected subgraph that includes 0-1-2 which satisfy the condition of strongly connecting components i.e each node is reachable from every other nodes.

Another subgraph includes individual nodes 4 and 3. That gives us a total of 3 subgraphs satisfying the condition of strongly connected components.

            modifiedDfs(adj, visited, i, st);
        }
    }
