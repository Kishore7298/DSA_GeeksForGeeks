## Minimum Spanning Tree or Prim's algorithm

Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph. The task is to find the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.

#### Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains two integers V (starting from 1), E denoting the number of nodes and number of edges. Then in the next line are 3\*E space separated values a b w where a, b denotes an edge from a to b and w is the weight of the edge.

#### Output:

For each test case in a new line print the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree formed of the graph.

#### User task:

Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function `spanningTree()` which takes number of vertices V and the number of edges E and a graph graph as inputs and returns an integer denoting the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
Note: Please note that input of graph is 1-based but the adjacency matrix is 0-based.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(V2)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(V)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= V <= 1000
V-1 <= E <= (V*(V-1))/2
1 <= a, b <= N
1 <= w <= 1000
Graph is connected and doesn't contain self loops & multiple edges.
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
2
3 3
1 2 5 2 3 3 1 3 1
2 1
1 2 5

Output:
4
5

Example:
Testcase 1:  Sum of weights of edges in the minimum spanning tree is 4.
```

```c++
// Function to construct and print MST for
// a graph represented using adjacency
// matrix representation, with V vertices.
// graph[i][j] = weight if edge exits else INT_MAX
/*
    Steps for Prim's MST:
        1. Create two arrays, one for storing minimum spanning tree and the other for keeping track of finalized nodes.
        2. Mark the distance of oth node as 0
        3. Start the iteration and in every iteration pick the non finalized minimum number
            finalize it and update the distance of it's adjacent nodes.
            (Note: The updating adj shouldn't be finalized)
        4. While finalizing the nodes add node distance to a variable, that is the sum of MST
