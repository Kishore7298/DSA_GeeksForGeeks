#### Minimum Swaps to Sort

Given an array of integers. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

#### Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the no of element of the array A[ ]. In the next line are N space separated values of the array A[ ] .

#### Output:

For each test case in a new line output will be an integer denoting minimum umber of swaps that are required to sort the array.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[] <= 10^6
```

#### User Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minSwaps() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns an integer denoting the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array. If the array is already sorted, return 0.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(NlogN)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

#### Example(To be used only for expected output):

```
Input:
2
5
1 5 4 3 2
4
8 9 16 15

Output:
2
1

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We need two swaps, swap 2 with 5 and 3 with 4 to make it sorted.
```

```c++
// return the minimum number of swaps required to sort the arra
int minSwaps(int arr[], int N){
    pair<int, int> arrPos[N];
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        arrPos[i] = {arr[i], i};    // storing the array elements and its position
    }
    sort(arrPos, arrPos+N); // Sorting based on the array elements.
    int ans = 0;
    bool visited[N] = { false };
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        int j = i;
        int cycle = 0;
        while(visited[j] == false) {    // if it is not visited
            visited[j] = true;
            j = arrPos[j].second;   // Taking the original position of the element (It stops when it reaches where it started from)
            cycle++;
        }
        if(cycle > 0)   // IMP: else cycle -1 will yeild wrong negative
            ans += (cycle-1);
    }
    return ans;
}
```
