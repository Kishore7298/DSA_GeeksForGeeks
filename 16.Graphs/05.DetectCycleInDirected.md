## Detect cycle in a directed graph

Given a Directed Graph. Check whether it contains any cycle or not.

#### Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then 'T' test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. Description of testcases is as follows: The First line of each test case contains two integers 'N' and 'M' which denotes the no of vertices and no of edges respectively. The Second line of each test case contains 'M' space separated pairs u and v denoting that there is an uni-directed edge from u to v .

#### Output:

The method should return 1 if there is a cycle else it should return 0.

#### User task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCyclic which takes the Graph and the number of vertices and inputs and returns true if the given directed graph contains a cycle. Else, it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(V)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1<= N,M <= 1000
0 <= u,v <= N-1
```

Example:

```
Input:
3
2 2
0 1 0 0
4 3
0 1 1 2 2 3
4 3
0 1 2 3 3 2
Output:
1
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: In the above graph there are 2 vertices. The edges are as such among the vertices.
```

```c++
bool modifiedDfs(vector<int> adj[], int curr, bool visited[], bool callStack[]) {
    visited[curr] = true;
    callStack[curr] = true; // This is required because for the case 1 -> 2 <- 3 (visited alone doesn't work)

    for(int j: adj[curr]) {
        if(visited[j] == false && modifiedDfs(adj, j, visited, callStack) == true)
            return true;
        else
            if(visited[j] == true && callStack[j] == true)  // already present in the callstack, so cycle
                return true;
    }
    callStack[curr] = false;
    return false;
}


/*  Function to check if the given graph contains cycle
*   V: number of vertices
*   adj[]: representation of graph
*/
bool isCyclic(int V, vector<int> adj[])
{
    bool visited[V] = {0};  // To check if the vertice is visited or not
    bool callStack[V] = {0};    //Keeps track of the call stack
    for(int i=0; i<V; i++) {
        if(visited[i] == false) {   // For all the disconnected vertices
            if(modifiedDfs(adj, i, visited, callStack) == true) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Another approach would be to use kahn's algorithm, as it finds the indegree of all the nodes so even upon dependency elimination, if there exists node with dependency then the graph has cycle
