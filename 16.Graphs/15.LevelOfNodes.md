## Level of Nodes

Given an connected undirected graph of N edges and a node X is given. The task is to find the level of X. if X does not exist in the graph then print -1.

![graph](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/level-graph1.png)

#### Input:

First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains number of nodes and edges N and E. Next E lines contais U and V, which represents that there is an edge between U and V. The final line contains X whose level we have to find.

#### Output:

For each testcase, print the level of the given node X.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= N <= 104
1 <= E <= (N*(N-1))/2
0 <= U, V < N
1 <= X <= 104
Graph doesn't contain multiple edges and self loops.
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
1
8 8
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 6
6 7
2 5
7

Output:
3

Explanation:
Testcases 1: In the given graph(above), 7 is at 3rd level starting from source node 0 which is at 0th level.
```

```c++
int Graph::levels( int x, int in){
    bool visited[V] = { false };
    queue<pair<int, int>> q; // stores value and the level
    q.push({0, x});
    visited[0] = true;
    while(q.empty() == false) {
        pair<int, int> elem = q.front();
        q.pop();
        int element = elem.first;
        int level = elem.second;
        if(element == in) {
            return level;
        } else {
            for(int i: adj[element]) {  // All the adjacent of element
                if(visited[i] == false) {
                    q.push({i, level+1});
                    visited[i] = true;  // Adding here is efficient, because it avoids the recursion if adjacent elements are linked
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
