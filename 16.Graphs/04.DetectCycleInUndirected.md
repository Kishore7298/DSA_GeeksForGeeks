## Detect cycle in an undirected graph

Given a Undirected Graph. Check whether it contains a cycle or not.

#### Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then 'T' testcases follow. Each testcase consists of two lines. Description of testcases are as follows: The First line of each testcase contains two integers 'N' and 'M' which denotes the no of vertices and no of edges respectively. The Second line of each test case contains 'M' space separated pairs u and v denoting that there is a bidirectional edge from u to v .

#### Output:

The method should return 1 if there is a cycle else it should return 0.

#### User task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCyclic which takes the Graph and the number of vertices as inputs and returns true if the given undirected graph contains any cycle. Else, it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(V)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= N <= 104
1 <= M <= (N*(N-1))/2
0 <= u, v <=  N-1
Graph doesn't contain multiple edges and self loops.
```

Example:

```
Input:
3
2 1
0 1
4 3
0 1 1 2 2 3
5 4
0 1 2 3 3 4 4 2

Output:
0
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: There is a graph with 2 vertices and 1 edge from 0 to 1. So there is no cycle.
Testcase 2: There is a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges from 0 to 1, 1 to 2 and 2 to 3.
Testcase 3: There is a cycle in the given graph formed by vertices 2, 3 and 4.
```

```c++
bool modifiedDfs(vector<int> g[], int v, int curr, bool visited[], int parent) {
    visited[curr] = true;
    for(int i: g[curr]) {   // For all the adjacent vertices
        if(visited[i] == false) {
            if(modifiedDfs(g, v, i, visited, curr) == true) // if the connected node has detected the cycle
                return true;
        } else {
            if(i != parent) //if already visites and it is not a parent, which means cycle exists
                return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

/* This function is used to detect a cycle in undirected graph

*  g[]: array of vectors to represent graph
*  V: number of vertices
*/
bool isCyclic(vector<int> g[], int V)
{
   bool visited[V+1] = {0};
   for(int i=0; i<V; i++) { // Running this for all the not connected nodes
       if(visited[i] == false) {
           if(modifiedDfs(g, V, i, visited, -1) == true)
            return true;
       }
   }
   return false;
}
```
