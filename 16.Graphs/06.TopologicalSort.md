## Topological sort

Given a Directed Graph. Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.

#### Input:

The first line of input takes the number of test cases then T test cases follow . Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers E and V representing no of edges and the number of vertices. Then in the next line are E pairs of integers u, v representing an edge from u to v in the graph.

#### Output:

For each test case output will be 1 if the topological sort is done correctly else it will be 0.

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `topoSort()` which takes the adjacency list of the Graph and the number of vertices (N) as inputs are returns an array consisting of a the vertices in Topological order. As there are multiple Topological orders possible, you may return any of them.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(V)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= V <= 104
1 <= E <= (N*(N-1))/2
0 <= u, v <= N-1
Graph doesn't contain multiple edges, self loops and cycles.
Graph may be disconnected.
```

Example:

```
Input
2
6 6
5 0 5 2 2 3 4 0 4 1 1 3
3 4
3 0 1 0 2 0

Output:
1
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The output 1 denotes that the order is valid.  So, if you have implemented your function correctly, then output would be 1 for all test cases.
```

```c++
void modifiedBfs(vector<int> adj[], int v, int inorder[], vector<int> &res) {
    queue<int> q;
    for(int i=0; i<v; i++) {
        if(inorder[i] == 0) { // No dependency
            q.push(i);
        }
    }
    while(q.empty() == false) {
        int elem = q.front();
        q.pop();
        res.push_back(elem);
        for(int i: adj[elem]) {
            inorder[i]--;   // Remove the dependency, as current element has popped
            if(inorder[i] == 0) // Elements with zero dependency are added to the queue
                q.push(i);
        }
    }
}

// The Graph structure is as folows

/*  Function which sorts the graph vertices in topological form
*   N: number of vertices
*   adj[]: input graph
*/
vector<int> topoSort(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
    int inorder[V+1] = {0};   // Creating the inorder array
    for(int i=0; i<V; i++)
        for(int j: adj[i])
            inorder[j]++;   // Populating the inorder array
    vector<int> res;
    modifiedBfs(adj, V, inorder, res);
    return res;
}
```

#### Topological Sort using DFS

1. Create an empty stack st
2. For every vertex u, do following

```c++
if (u is not visited)
    Dfs(u, st)
```

3.

```c++
while(st is not empty) {
    pop and print
}
```

---

```
Dfs(u, st) {
    1. Mark u as visited
    2. For every adjacent v of u
        if(v is not visited)
            Dfs(v, st)
    3. Push u to st
}
```
