## Shortest path in a DAG

Given a DAG with weights between the vertices and the source, we need to find the shortest distance between the source and all the vertices in the Graph

#### Solution:

1. Input given Adj , s(source)
2. dist[s] = 0; // Distance from source to source is zero
3. Find Topological sort of the graph
4. For every vertex u in the topological sort  
   a) For every adjacent v of u
   ```
       if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight(u, v)
            dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
   ```
